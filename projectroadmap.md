## Sprint 1
- [x] Establish a Github account and connect to class organization (KSU-IS) in Github.
- [x] Create a code repository in our Github organization.
- [x] Edited and committed changes in a readme.md file in a repository in our Github organization.
- [x] Explored at least one existing Python code base related to the project to evaluate using it in the project.
- **Example Code Found: https://github.com/Harini1210-ravi/Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship-task-2.git**
- [x] Read the code and attempt to run it yourself.
- **Code runs with no error and uses import commands and functions to load and save to a file that would be useful when building my code. The expense, income, and calculation functions defined reflect my plans for the program. It lacks my plans to print a message evaluating the result of the users budget. If a poor evaluation is given, student should try again after program automatically exits.**
## Sprint 2
- [x] Create a .py file in the repository and begin building the code.
- **Created as budgettracker.py**
- [ ] Create at least 6 commits with detailed comments about the changes to the code.
- **Created import statements and created functions that save transactions to a file then load them for later use.**
- [ ] Assess progress on planned and emerging tasks in this file.
## Sprint 3
- [ ] Design a powerpoint slide presenting the budget tracker.
- [ ] Add powerpoint slide to README file in repository.
